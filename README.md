# Long War of the Chosen Rebalanced (LWOTC-R)

This is a fundamental rebalance of Long War of the Chosen, with the following design goals:

1.  Significantly lower the reliance on alpha striking (more 3-4 + turn engagements than 1-2 turn ones)
2.  Eliminate the need to manage pod activations
3.  A wide variety of distinct tools for the player, and a wide range of distinct challenges to deal with, such as:
- Much more distinct enemy design
- Significantly more nuanced perk trees and equipment 
4. More even pacing and difficulty of the campaign
5. Repurpose stealth from an ambush and combat avoidance tool to a scouting and defensive one.


## Current State
Currently the Mod is in alpha, in a playable but feature incomplete and unpolished state.

Particularly, the not-implemented features (In this case: Not rebalanced/redesigned yet) so far include:
* Psi ops
* Sparks
* Alien Hunters DLC
* The Chosen (should disable them in Second Wave options)

Also, Gotcha again overwatch indicators are unreliable for now.

## Features

Here's a headline list of features of this mod

### Podless
* As soon as you are spotted, every enemy in the map activates. Enemy count, XCOM HP and injury recovery times, and defensive tools are all redesigned with this in mind. 

### Revamped concealment
* With some exceptions, shared concealment now breaks at the start of the 2nd turn.

* Phantom is reworked to temporarily concealing yourself as a free action for 1 turn. (with 3 charges)

* Enemy Detection ranges are severely decreased

* Shadow is keeping its LWOTC Variant

### Grenade Scatter

* Grenades are overall more powerful, but also more unreliable, and can now scatter just like rockets.
* Damage falloff is also quite a bit harsher, and grenades and normal rockets do not shred.

### Cover
* Cover Defense is further increased to 40/55 from 30/45 - significantly raising the value of cover
* Base Flanking crit bonus increased to 50% from 40%

### Ammo management
* Reload is now turn ending
* Pistols and autopistols no longer carry any mobility penalty
* Sawed-off can now be equipped in a pistol slot 

### Attachments
* Attachments now only have 1 tier, and supply is infinite as soon as you research Modular Weapons (do so early)
* All weapons now start with only 1 attachment slot, and can gain 2 more slots by researching proving ground projects

Attachments have been rebalanced to:
* Scope - Gain 5 aim
* Laser sight - Gain 10 crit

* Hair trigger - After a miss, gain +25 aim
* Stock - Missed attacks have a 35% chance to become a graze. Your attacks ignore up to 15 dodge

* Expended magazine - Gain +1 weapon capacity
* Auto-loader - Grants quick reload - Reloads up to 2 ammo, non-turn ending

### Overwatch and suppression
Overwatch has been overhauled:

* Overwatch is now: Fire on the first enemy within line of sight of this soldier (at the time of activating Overwatch) that moves. No aim penalty and ignores cover defense. A unit can only go on overwatch if it has an enemy in line of sight
* Overwatch is no longer removed upon taking damage

Similar to LWR overwatch rules, except it doesn't have covering fire by default. This is an important mechanic change because:
* Makes sure not every mission is a spawn defense with podless
* Makes reinforcements (RNF) something that you will have to deal with instead of just blowing up instantly
* Makes overwatch strong without needing multiple overwatch perks beforehand

* Suppression is now: Fire a barrage that pins down a target, reducing their action points by 1 (units unable to take cover are immune), restricting the use of many abilities, and imposing a 15 penalty to the target's aim. Grants an  overwatch shot that deals half damage if the target moves.

These changes make suppression far more effective at locking down units, and far less effective at killing them.

### Soldiers

* All soldiers now start as squaddies - Eliminates the boring rookie phase where your toolset was severely limited

* All soldier trees have been redesigned to have their role defining tools/power spikes happen earlier in the tree than later - Makes the builds go online a lot sooner, and decreases the impact of losing higher ranked soldiers, and increases the ability to more easily replace them

* Soldier base stats have been rescaled like this:
8 base HP
80 base aim
15 base mobility
40 base will

* Soldier HP, Aim and Will growths have been completely removed - Makes sure cover is just as important early game as it is late

* All soldier classes (except templars) now have access to the following "Universal" primary weapon categories: Assault rifle, Shotgun, SMG, Bullpup, Vektor, Grenade launcher

##### Classes

* The Ranger and Grenadier classes have been removed - their "niches" have been incorporated into the builds of other classes,
sawed-offs are now universal sidearm slot weapons, grenade launchers are now universal primary weapons.

###### Gunner Class
* New Squaddie set of perks - Suppression, flush, bladestorm knife fighter

###### Technical Class
* No longer has gauntlet, instead the technical has a rocket launcher secondary weapon, and is the only class that can equip a primary flamethrower called an immolator

* Can Equip several new rocket types, detailed in the weapons section
* Immolator allows to equip special canisters in the sidearm slot, detailed in the weapons section


###### Shinobi Class
* New Squaddie set of perks - Phantom, Slash, Whirlwind
* Phantom has been reworked to: Temporarily conceal yourself for 1 turn with no detection radius. Standard Slash attack does not reveal you. 3 charges

###### Assault Class
* New Squaddie set of perks - Close encounters, Arc thrower stun


###### Sharpshooter Class
* Same Squaddie set of perks - Squadsight, Holotarget, except:
* Holotargeting is now a free action, on a 3 turn cooldown


###### Specialist Class
* New Squaddie set of perks - Aid Protocol, Blinding Protocol, Combat Protocol

You can find new class trees [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sdk8q8FWuxaaPSpgdK1BOIwQZYgUXXFv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101693235569137515434&rtpof=true&sd=true)

### Enemies

* Enemy Aim and Will growths have been completely removed - Makes sure cover is just as important early game as it is late
* Rescaled all enemies across 5 tiers, scaled from FL 1 to FL 25
* New tier naming is : Basic, Advanced, Elite, Supreme, With T5 enemies having special names
* Incorporated over 100 new permament dark events as new and unpredictable enemy scaling
* Removed Najas - squadsight doesn't fit that well in podless
* Removed MEC Archers - squadsight doesn't fit and they weren't an interesting enough enemy
* Removed ADVENT grenadiers, rocketeers, scouts, sergeants, commandos, vanguards and shock troopers - Their variants have been incorporated elsewhere

* Acid burn: One of the few sources of shred, the game is getting changed so armor is overall rarer but shred is much, MUCH less common and harder to do 

### Barracks

* Rookie promotion now happens on the basis of super classes: there are 3

Assault - Specialist

Sharpshooter - Shinobi

Gunner - Technical

#### NEW OFFICER TREE

## Installing and playing the mod

Installing the mod works exactly the same as normal lwotc, except you download it from here. You can find general instructions on LWOTC's [wiki page.](https://github.com/long-war-2/lwotc/wiki/Installing-Long-War-of-the-Chosen)

You can grab a release from either the discord sercver, or release section in this repository (experimental ones get posted on discord, more stable ones here)

If you have some kind of trouble or Want to give feedback you can join [LWOTC-R discord server](https://discord.gg/bNcp2V79FG), Or raise an issue in github

## Contributing translations

If you would like to contribute to translations for LWOTC, then check out the
[wiki page](https://github.com/long-war-2/lwotc/wiki/Contributing#localization-translating-text-in-the-game)
that explains how it works.

## Building and running the mod

If you want to contribute changes to code or assets, then you will need to
build the mod so that you can test them. Before you can do that, you need to
set some things up:

 1. Make sure you have the WOTC SDK `full_content` branch installed - see the
    [xcom2mods wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcom2mods/wiki/index#wiki_setting_up_tools_for_modding)
    for details on how to do that (plus lots of other useful information)

 2. [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
    and then clone your fork locally, which you can do via [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
    (a command-line tool), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), or some other
    git client tool

 3. Once you have cloned the repository, you may need to pull the code for the embedded
    highlander. If the *X2WOTCCommunityHighlander* directory is empty, then use the
    command line from the project's root directory (the one containing this README.md):
    ```
        > git submodule update --init
    ```
    or whatever is the equivalent with the git client tool you are using.

 4. Obtain the LWOTC-R media assets (video, graphics and sound) from [this Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/209rybpdl3khb26/lwotc-content.zip?dl=0)
    and unpack the resulting zip file into this project's *LongWarOfTheChosen* directory.  The link is not up to date with assets added in LWOTC-R, so you will also need to copy over the *LongWarOfTheChosen/Content* directory from one of the released alpha builds.

 5. Set up the following environment variables:
    * `XCOM2SDKPATH` — typically &lt;path to Steam&gt;\steamapps\common\XCOM 2 War Of The Chosen SDK
    * `XCOM2GAMEPATH` — typically &lt;path to Steam&gt;\steamapps\common\XCOM 2\XCom2-WarOfTheChosen
    Don't put these paths in quotes.
	
 6. Open a new command prompt after setting those environment variables and run
    the following from the LWOTC project directory:
    ```
    > build-lwotc.bat -config default
    ```
    (You can specify `-config debug` to compile with debug info)
 
 7. Compilation may fail with errors that certain classes variables and functions in the Community Highlander are private/protected, rather than protected/public.  Edit the corresponding file within the *X2WOTCCommunityHighlander* directory and change variables from private->protected and functions from protected->public as needed to resolve each error.
 
 8. You should also build this modified Community Highlander. Follow [the most up to date instructions in that repository](https://github.com/X2CommunityCore/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander#cooking-a-final-release-automated-method) (CookCommunityHighlander.bat)

Once the highlander and LWOTC-R are built, you will be able to select them as local
mods in Alternative Mod Launcher and run Long War of the Chosen Rebalanced.
